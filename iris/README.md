## PROBLEM

Given sizes of sepal and petal, can you classify which species of Iris it's from?

By the way, here's a image of a flower with sepal and petal:

## WHY I chose this data set

* this is the first data set I used when I learnt machine learning
* small, simple and clean data set
* typical test case for machine learning techniques

Data Cleaness:  Very Clean
Pre-processing: Minimal
Problem Type:   Classification
Difficulty:     Easy
